![original](images/martin_fieber.png)

**Senior Product Engineer @ S2**
**_@MartinHelmut_**

---

# What do I mean with **options**?

---

# [fit] **Different tools**, different needs

^ - Depending on what you want to achieve, there are different ways to get there
- From full blown tools managing your whole projects, to small install helper

---

# Some clarification

^ - Therefore, some clarification are needed
- An important one is that this is a quick overview
- The goal is not to give you a deep dive, but I will provide links where you can get that

---

## [fit] No **A** versus **B**

^ - This is not a direct comparison
- Depending on what you need, you should choose the tool for your need
- I just want to show 4 options available
- This also means that this list will not be complete, there are more options still out there

---

# [fit] Let's start

---

# Number **1**, **2**, **3** and **4**

^ - Let's give this options a name ... (next slide)

---

# Options

[.autoscale: true]
[.build-lists: true]

* TypeScript "--build"
* Yarn workspaces
* Lerna
* Rush.js

---

# [fit] Setup

^ - First things first, I use the same projects for every example
- And this is how it looks like ... (next slide)

---

```
app/
    src/
        index.ts
utils/
    src/
        index.ts
```

^ - Simple application that depends on utils
- Here is utils ... (next slide)

---

```typescript
// utils/src/index.ts
export function getHello(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
```

^ - A function that gets exported
- And here is the app ... (next slide)

---

```typescript
// app/src/index.ts
import { getHello } from '@scope/utils';

console.log(getHello('Everyone'));
```

^ - This is the basic setup that will be used for every example

---

# TypeScript "--build"

^ - Let's se how we can achieve this with the TypeScript compiler

---

`npm i typescript`

^ - Overall can be installed with
- And the project setup looks like this (next slide)

---

```
root/
    src/
        app/
            index.ts
            tsconfig.json
        utils/
            index.ts
            tsconfig.json
        tsconfig.json
    package.json
    tsconfig.json
```

^ - Here is the folder structure and you already see that the `tsconfig.json` defines projects
- The root `tsconfig.json` defines the basic compiler options ... (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "es5",
        "strict": true,
        "baseUrl": "src",
        "outDir": "./dist"
    }
}
```

^ // tsconfig.json
- The tsconfig in my `src` folder defines my project references ... (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
    "references": [
        { "path": "./app" },
        { "path": "./utils" }
    ]
}
```

^ // src/tsconfig.json
- The source config extends the compiler options and defines the project references
- And the project configurations add custom settings needed as well as some required properties

---

```json
{
    "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "declarationMap": true,
        "declaration": true,
        "composite": true
    },
    "include": [ "src/**/*" ],
    "exclude": [ "node_modules" ]
}
```

^ // src/utils/tsconfig.json
- This extends the source config, defines some compiler options like the needed `composite` and includes necessary files

---

```typescript
import { getHello } from '../utils';
```

^ - Imports from app to utils would look like this (relative imports)
- The `package.json` looks like this: (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "name": "root",
    "private": true,
    "main": "dist/src/app/index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc --build",
        "start": "node dist/src/app/index.js"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "typescript": "^3.2.1"
    }
}
```

^ - The build command is `tsc --build`.
- And can be used as ... (next slide)

# [fit] **Why?**

---

"By doing this, you can greatly improve build times, enforce logical separation between components, and organize your code ..."

^ - This is taken directly from TypeScrips documentation about this feature
- And more or less gives you the benefit, faster builds with TypeScript
- Disadvantage is, that that there is a bit more needed to remove relative paths for projects
- And it would be more effort to get separate deployable packages out of this
- Also there is no out-of-the-box way to manage separated dependencies

---

_typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html_

^ - And here you can find the documentation

---

# Yarn workspaces

^ - Let's see how we can achieve multi project management with Yarn workspaces
- How to install Yarn you can find here: (next slide)

---

_yarnpkg.com/docs/install_

^ - The project will look like the following (next slide)

---

```
root/
    @scope/
        app/
            src/
                index.ts
            package.json
            tsconfig.json
        utils/
            src/
                index.ts
            package.json
            tsconfig.json
    package.json
```

^ - Here is the folder structure
- Here you see that this more resembles separated packages
- The folder `@scope` is intended to get imports like: (next slide)

---

```typescript
import { getHello } from '@scope/utils';
```

^ - The workspace setting is included inside your package.json (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "name": "root",
    "private": true,
    "workspaces": [
        "@scope/*"
    ],
    "devDependencies": {
        "typescript": "^3.2.1"
    }
}
```

^ - This defines that everything in `@scope` is a workspace
- This will hoist the dependencies to the root
- Therefore if I execute yarn ... (next slide)

---

```shell
$ yarn
```

^ - It will install all the dependencies on root level.
- And connects the inner dependencies, e.g.: (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "@scope/utils": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

^ - But Yarn will not help redirecting commands to every sub-project
- So I need to build all by packages,
- Or define your own scripts for this task,
- Or you combine this with TypeScript --build flag if it is a TypeScript projects

---

# [fit] This is up to you ðŸ¤“

---

# [fit] **Why?**

^ - Where TypeScript --build gave you a central way to build projects,
- Yarn gives a central way to install and manage dependencies for your projects
- Think about combining this and you get almost a fancy MonoRepo solution

---

_yarnpkg.com/docs/workspaces_

^ - Documentation

# Lerna

^ - Let's get to a more comprehensive way to manage multiple projects: Lerna

---

"Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm."

^ - This means it gives you access to ... (next slide)

---

[.autoscale: true]
[.build-lists: true]

* Dependency management
* Command execution
* Version management
* Publishing

^ // Go through list first.
- Projects using Lerna e.g.: Babel, React, Angular and Jest

---

```
root/
    packages/
        app/
            src/
                index.ts
            package.json
            tsconfig.json
        utils/
            src/
                index.ts
            package.json
            tsconfig.json
    lerna.json
    package.json
```

^ - This is how it could look like, with every projects by default inside `packages`
- The `lerna.json` file is the basic configuration (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "packages": [
        "packages/*"
    ],
    "version": "independent"
}
```

^ - When using a command like `lerna init` this will be the created default
- Package versions are independent here (this was done by a flag)
- To generate this and get help creating a mono repo you can use: (next slide)

---

`npx lerna init --independent`

^ - Hint: If creating a repo with Lerna you could combine this with Yarn workspaces as well (for default dependency hoisting)
- In use Lerna could look like (next slide)

---

![inline autoplay](videos/lerna.mov)

---

## [fit] Run and execute

^ - Lerna now can execute or pass commands for you
- In your root `package.json` you can define this in two different ways (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "test": "lerna run --parallel test",
        "clean": "lerna exec -- rm -fr dist"
    }
}
```

^ - First version executes the npm-script `test` in all your packages
- The second version executes the command `rm` directly in every package
- Lerna can also handle versioning of your packages ... (next slide)

---

`npx lerna version`

^ - By executing this (next slide)

---

[.autoscale: true]
[.build-lists: true]

* Identifies packages that have been updated since the previous tagged release.
* Prompts for a new version.
* Modifies package metadata to reflect new release.
* Commits those changes and tags the commit.
* Pushes to the git remote.

^ - You get the following (show list)
- This also gives you help for publishing ... (next slide)

---

`npx lerna publish`

^ - Executes `lerna version` and publish packages with new versions to your defined registry
- But Lerna can also ... (next slide)

---

[.autoscale: true]
[.build-lists: true]

* Generate Changelogs
* Conventional commits support
* Hoist dependencies without Yarn

^ // Show feature list
- For more features and details you can view the documentation here ... (next slide)

---

_lernajs.io_

^ - And if you want to start with working with a Lerna Repo, there is a helpful tool (next slide)

---

_github.com/szarouski/lerna-wizard_

^ - This gives you guidance for working with a Lerna MonoRepo
- And there is still option 4 ... (next slide)

---

# Rush.js

^ - Developed by Microsoft

---

"... JavaScript developers who build and publish many packages from a common Git repo."

^ - Taken from the Documentation
- Similar to Lerna, but with some differences (next slide)

---

## [fit] Configuration ðŸ”§

^ - One of this is you have to configure more
- But this also gives you more options for the "How"
- To get started you need to install rush ... (next slide)

---

`npm i -g @microsoft/rush`

^ - Lets view the Rush.js repo setup: (next slide)

---

```
root/
    apps/
        app/
            src/
                index.ts
            package.json
            tsconfig.json
    libraries/
        utils/
            src/
                index.ts
            package.json
            tsconfig.json
    common/config/rush
        // ...
    rush.json
```

^ - There are category folder `apps` and `libraries` as well as a `common` that can contain configurations
- Also there is no root `package.json` but a `rush.json` for the basic configuration (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/rush/v5/rush.schema.json",
    "rushVersion": "5.5.2",
    "pnpmVersion": "2.15.1",
    "nodeSupportedVersionRange": ">=8.9.4 <11.0.0",
    "projectFolderMinDepth": 2,
    "projectFolderMaxDepth": 2,
    "projects": [
        {
            "packageName": "@scope/app",
            "projectFolder": "apps/app"
        },
        {
            "packageName": "@scope/utils",
            "projectFolder": "libraries/utils"
        }
    ]
}
```

^ - This is how the `rush.json` looks like, but let's get through it step by step (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "$schema": ".../json-schemas/rush/v5/rush.schema.json",
    "rushVersion": "5.5.2",
    "pnpmVersion": "2.15.1",
    "nodeSupportedVersionRange": ">=8.9.4 <11.0.0",
}
```

^ - First line url to schema, second rush, third package manager, and node range
- Next two options ... (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "projectFolderMinDepth": 2,
    "projectFolderMaxDepth": 2,
}
```

^ - ... enforce that category folder will be used for all projects

---

```json
{
    "projects": [
        {
            "packageName": "@scope/app",
            "projectFolder": "apps/app"
        },
        {
            "packageName": "@scope/utils",
            "projectFolder": "libraries/utils"
        }
    ]
}
```

^ - And you have to specify all projects you use with package name and folder
- But there are more options
- This can be default generated with ... (next slide)

---

`rush init`

^ - This will give you good basic setup and create a `rush.json` with a lot of documentation for every option
- And then you can use it ... (next slide)

---

![inline autoplay](videos/lerna.mov)

^ - Also, some of the options are ... (next slide)

---

## Event Hooks

```json
{
    "eventHooks": {
        "preRushBuild": [
            "path to a script"
        ]
    }
}
```

---

## Git policies

```json
{
    "gitPolicy": {
        "allowedEmailRegExps": []
    }
}
```

^ - Restrict allowed emails
- And define commands ... (next slide)

---

## Commands

`common/config/rush/command-line.json`

^ - Located in its own configuration file, and could contain: (next slide)

---

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
          "commandKind": "bulk",
          "name": "test",
          "summary": "Test each project sources",
          "description": "Here is a long description ..."
        }
    ]
}
```

^ - Bulk command that executes the npm-script `test` in every project
- But it could also be a global command:

---

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "commandKind": "global",
            "name": "deploy",
            "summary": "Deploy applications to ...",
            "description": "...",
            "shellCommand": "path/to/deploy.script"
        }
    ]
}
```

^ // Explain global command
- Info: The rush command can be executed everywhere inside your repository
- This could look like (next slide)

---

```shell
$ rush test
$ rush deploy
```

---

[.autoscale: true]
[.build-lists: true]

## Other features worth to mention?

* Version policies
* Publish packages
* Changelog generation
* Scan and integrity checks

^ // Go through list
// One example for scans -> check dependencies
- There is more (next slide)
